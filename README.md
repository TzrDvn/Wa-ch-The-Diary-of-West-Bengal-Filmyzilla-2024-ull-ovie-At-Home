It raises questions about the treatment of minorities, the role of religion in society, and the complexities of historical events.

If The Diary of West Bengal arrives on Disney+ exactly 100 days after its theatrical release, that would mean the sequel will be made available on September 22, 2024.

Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the streaming platform can choose from two available options.
